        <h6>The US Department of the Interior's responsibilies span the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural and historical resources, The also manage administration of programs relating to Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, territorial affairs, and insular areas of the United States. Due to their large scope, their website has a large amount of information that needs to be presented to a broad audience.</h6>

          <li>inconsistent navigation between different sections of site</li>

        <h4>Proto-persona & Analysis</h4>
        <h6>I created Paul as a starting point for imagining the journey a user would take through the DoI’s current site. As I followed his journey, I took notes of the strengths and weaknesses of each page’s design and what elements could prevent Paul from accomplishing his goals.</h6>

        <h4>Usability Testing & Navigation Redesign</h4>
        <h6><span id="bold">Only 1 out of our 5 testers</span> were able to complete all 3 tasks in our usability test for the current site. It was not clear what was clickable in the header navigation. A <span id="bold">lack of universal navigation in the site header</span> led to users getting stuck in certain sections of the site and having to navigate back to the homepage. Also, heavy jargon and duplicated content across sections of the site made navigation difficult.</h6>
        <h6>With this feedback, I started by conducting a card stort to determine the best way to organize the header menu to reduce this confusion. I removed the “bureaus and offices” section from the header navigation and distributed those links into the “about” section. I also rephrased several sections to remove jargon that users found confusing in testing. There were several duplicate titles that I also removed.</h6>
        <div class="jennifer">
            <img src="/Images/doi-card-sort.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%">

        </div>
        <p>New Sitemap</p>
    <div class="design-intro">
        <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
        <h6>Users of the current site felt overwhelmed by the amount of information on the current homepage, and also found the content chunking confusing and duplicative. To solve for this, I started by simplifying the homepage down to only include a carousal of the most recent posts and updates of department activities, and an option to subscribe for email updates.</h6>
        <div class="first-design">
          <img src="/Images/doi-homepage-first.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <h6>However, this design proved to be too simple. 5 second test results showed that users still didn’t understand what the DoI did and how it pertained to them. While they were drawn to the carousel based on its prominence on the page, they didn’t fully understand how the different articles and videos were related to eachother.</h6>
        <h6>The second iteration of the homepage removed the carousel in the hero and instead provided the DoI’s mission. The news updates were moved below the hero and broken out into a grid so that all the information could be seen immediately.</h6>
        <div class="image-flex">

            <img src="/Images/doi Mobile Home.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%">
          </div>
        </div>
        <h6>After receiving feedback that the weekly DoI update video being included along with the recent blog posts was not intuitive, I further iterated on this layout for my high fidelity prototype and brought back a video carousel towards the bottom of the page for only the update videos.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="final-design">
        <h4>Implementing a Design Sytem for the final Solution</h4>
        <h6>I derived my main color palette from the oranges, browns, and teals found their logo. The old site was predominantly blue, but I chose these warmer colors to brighten up the site and evoke nature and the outdoors with earthier tones. I also went with rounded fonts to make all their long form content seem more friendly and approachable.</h6>

        <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
        <h6>The final iteration of the site was much more successful, with all 5 users tests being completed successfully.</h6>
        <h6>This project was unique for me since it was my first time designing without acess to any of stakeholders for the organization. This made me more reliant on my own conclusions and user research, which was a valuable experience.</h6>
